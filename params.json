{"name":"KVM/ARM Open Source Project","tagline":"Staging for all KVM/ARM development","body":"### Welcome to KVM/ARM Open Source Project\r\nWe aim to provide fast, reliable, broad support for ARM virtualization in the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThere is a a main developement mailing list dedicated for the project. All patches for review, improvement suggestions or other issues related to the development and maintenance of the KVM/ARM code base should go here:\r\n* [kvmarm@lists.cs.columbia.edu]\r\n* [https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/cucslists/listinfo/kvmarm](https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/cucslists/listinfo/kvmarm). \r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Open Systems ([website](http://www.virtualopensystems.com)) maintains a guide on how to set up a KVM testing environment using the FAST models.\r\n\r\n### Hardware Support\r\nKVM/ARM has been tested and verified on ARM's FAST Models and on the following physical hardware platforms:\r\n* ARM TC-2 (Verstatile Express)\r\n* Samsung Exynos 5250 (Arndale Board and Chrome Book)\r\n* OMAP5\r\n\r\n### Development Workflow\r\nPatches should be sent to the kvmarm mailing list (see above) and should be cc'ed to the linux-arm-kernel mailing list [http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/lists.php](http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/lists.php).\r\n\r\nWe maintain two stable (non-rebasing) public branches:\r\n* kvm-arm-next: Patches intended for kvm-next, and subsequently the next merge window\r\n* kvm-arm-fixes: Tracks upstream and includes only fixes for -rcX releases.\r\n\r\nWe currently have one unstable branch, which rebases any time (please take care accordingly):\r\n* kvm-arm-staging: Staging area for patches to go into kvm-arm-next\r\n\r\n### Maintainer\r\n[Christoffer Dall](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cdall) (@chazy) is the maintainer of KVM/ARM.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
